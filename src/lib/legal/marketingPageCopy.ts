    bodyHtml: `<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>Astor Electronics operates this online store for components, phones, consoles, and related accessories. This policy explains how we handle your personal information when you browse, request a quote, or place an order.</p>
<h2>Information we collect</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account &amp; checkout:</strong> name, email address, shipping address, phone number, and order history.</li>
<li><strong>Quote requests:</strong> cart contents, contact details, and any notes you provide.</li>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> messages sent through our contact form or email.</li>
<li><strong>Newsletter:</strong> email address when you subscribe.</li>
<li><strong>Technical data:</strong> IP address, browser type, device information, and cookies (see our <a href="/pages/cookies">Cookie Policy</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h2>How we use your data</h2>
<p>We use your information to process orders and quotes, deliver products, provide customer support, prevent fraud, improve our website, and—where you have opted in—send marketing emails. We rely on contract performance, legitimate interests, and consent where required by law.</p>
<h2>Sharing your data</h2>
<p>We share data only with trusted processors that help us operate the store, including payment providers (Stripe), email delivery services, shipping carriers, and hosting providers. We do not sell your personal data.</p>
<h2>Retention</h2>
<p>Order and tax records are kept as required by law. Marketing preferences are kept until you unsubscribe. Contact form submissions are retained for support and audit purposes.</p>
<h2>Your rights (GDPR &amp; UK GDPR)</h2>
<p>If you are in the UK or EEA, you may request access, correction, deletion, restriction, portability, or object to certain processing. You may withdraw consent at any time and lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.</p>
<p>To exercise your rights, contact us via our <a href="/pages/contact">contact page</a>.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We use encryption in transit (HTTPS), access controls, and industry-standard practices to protect your data. No method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will always be published on this page.</p>`,

<p>By using astor-electronics.com you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, please do not use our site.</p>
<h2>Products &amp; pricing</h2>
<p>We sell new and refurbished electronics including PC components, mobile devices, and gaming hardware. Prices are shown in the currency configured at checkout. We may correct pricing errors before accepting an order. Product images are representative; specifications are listed on each product page.</p>
<h2>Quotes &amp; orders</h2>
<p>When quote checkout is enabled, submitting a cart creates a quote request—not a binding contract—until we confirm availability and final pricing. Paid orders through Stripe are confirmed when payment succeeds.</p>
<h2>Payment</h2>
<p>We accept major cards and digital wallets through our payment partners. You confirm that you are authorised to use the payment method provided.</p>
<h2>Shipping &amp; risk</h2>
<p>Delivery terms are described in our <a href="/pages/shipping">Shipping Information</a>. Title and risk pass to you upon delivery to the carrier unless otherwise required by law.</p>
<h2>Returns</h2>
<p>Unopened items in resaleable condition may be returned within 14 days of delivery unless excluded (e.g. opened software, personalised builds, or hygiene-sensitive accessories). Faulty items are covered under applicable consumer warranty laws—contact us with your order number.</p>
<h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Astor Electronics is not liable for indirect or consequential loss. Nothing in these terms limits your statutory consumer rights.</p>
<h2>Governing law</h2>
<p>These terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. Disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales unless mandatory consumer law provides otherwise.</p>`,
